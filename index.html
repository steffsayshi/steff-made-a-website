		<td>The Cambridge logo is a seal of approval and a promise of 
		excellence. It consists of the coat of arms (symbol) and the University 
		name (wordmark). They must always be used together. The&nbsp;Coat of 
		Arms&nbsp;must never be used on its own. The University has been able to use 
		substantially the same image for over 450 years, and it is protected by 
		law. In addition, we have no right to change the coat of arms (symbol) 
		without Royal Authority; it must remain true to its heraldic design 
		which was granted as an honour from The Crown. <br />
		<br />
		The&nbsp;University of Cambridge&nbsp;is a&nbsp;public&nbsp;collegiate&nbsp;&nbsp;in&nbsp;Cambridge, 
		England. Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the&nbsp;world's 
		third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's 
		founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the&nbsp;University of 
		Oxford&nbsp;for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.&nbsp;The 
		two&nbsp;ancient&nbsp;English universities, although sometimes described as 
		rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to 
		as&nbsp;Oxbridge. </td>

		<p>Although the Sports Centre provides a hub for Sport at Cambridge 
		University, anyone can become a member of our gym and use our 
		facilities. You do not need a connection to the University and we have 
		some competitive membership options available.</p>
		<p>Opened in 2013, the University Sports Centre has a&nbsp;Gym, Strength &amp; 
		Conditioning room, Sports Hall, Squash and Fives courts, Studios and a 
		Team Training Room used by international performance athletes. We offer 
		a wide range of sports clubs and fitness classes for both members and 
		casual users. Having top class&nbsp;facilities allows us to offer you one of 
		the best gyms in Cambridge.</p>
		<p>The Sports Service also maintains dedicated athletics and hockey 
		facilities at Wilberforce Road Sports Ground, while cricket and tennis 
		have their home at Fenner's, one of the country's most historic and 
		iconic sports venues. A range of other club and college grounds are 
		available across the city, catering to rugby, rowing, and many other 
		sports besides.</p>
		<p>Cambridge University is recognised as much for its illustrious 
		sporting tradition as it is for its excellence in education, learning 
		and research. Over the past 150 years, the University has been home to 
		some of the world's greatest sportsmen and women, from Michael Atherton, 
		to Emma Pooley, to a host of Olympians and Paralympians.</p>
		<p>That history translates into a vibrant sports scene in the University 
		today. With<span>&nbsp;</span>53 sports clubs<span>&nbsp;</span>and a range&nbsp;of 
		sporting societies, the University is one of the countries leading 
		centres for student sport. Cambridge regularly places in the top 20 
		universities in the country in BUCS competition, and a range of<span>&nbsp;</span>scholarships<span>&nbsp;</span>for 
		elite athletes are available.</p>
		<p>Sport at Cambridge is supported by our&nbsp;excellent facilities. The 
		University Sports Service is committed to developing sport within the 
		University and across Cambridgeshire. You can find out more on this 
		website, or you can<span>&nbsp;</span>contact us<span>&nbsp;</span>if you have 
		further questions.&nbsp;</p>
